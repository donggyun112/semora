"""The execution boundary: replay committed effects and expose uncertain execution.

Every tool call is a durable step keyed by its `tool_call_id`. `start` commits intent before the
tool runs and `finish_effect` commits the result after; a step already `done` is answered from the
record without running the tool, and a step `running` with no result is `Indeterminate` — the
ledger will not claim the effect went out, and will not claim it did not. A model request is a
durable step too, keyed by what was asked, so a recovering attempt replays the turn instead of
paying for it again and getting a different answer.

This is also the one catch boundary. A tool that raises failed; the round did not: the exception
becomes that call's recorded error result and the model is told. Runtime signals pass through
untouched, because a second catch above this one would convert exactly the signals it let through.

The control points are asked here, at the boundary, so a policy author never sees a Pydantic AI
hook: `pre_tool_use` before the effect, `post_tool_use` after it and once per call, `on_resume`
when an approved call comes back, and the three turn-level points around the graph's nodes.
