"""A class is an agent. Everything about it is in the class body, and an instance is one run.

```python
class Reviewer(Agent):
    \"\"\"Reviews a repository.\"\"\"      # its description, shown to a parent agent that delegates

    llm = "openai:gpt-5"
    store = MemorySteps()              # the ledger; leave it out and the agent runs plain
    transcript = MemoryTranscript()
    uses = (web_search, shell, FileSystem("."))   # functions, toolsets, MCP servers, capabilities

    def __init__(self, repo: Path, **kwargs) -> None:
        self.repo = repo
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

    def prompt(self) -> str:           # or a plain string attribute; a method re-renders per round
        return f"Review {self.repo}."

    @tool
    async def read(self, path: str) -> str: ...

    async def pre_tool_use(self, ctx, call): ...   # any of the seven control points

    on_inputs = Ingress(mask_cards, drop_empty)   # or a composed control as a class attribute
```

An instance holds its own state and is bound to one run:

```python
reviewer = Reviewer(Path("."))
outcome = await reviewer.run("review this repository")   # mints a run id, keeps it
if outcome.suspended:                                     # a park is an outcome, not an error
    outcome = await reviewer.resume({"type": "approve"})  # same instance, same run

# another process, hours later: a fresh instance bound to the same run
outcome = await Reviewer(Path("."), branch_id="run-1").recover()
```

A control point defined as a method replaces the parent's; call `super()` to keep it. A control
point assigned as a class attribute composes rules the way semora does — `Permissions(a, b)` lets
a denial win and remembers a suspension — so an agent with several rules declares them that way.

The names are ours, not Pydantic AI's, on purpose: `model`, `name`, `description`,
`instructions`, `toolsets` and `output_type` are properties or decorators on Pydantic AI's
`Agent`, and a class attribute with one of those names would shadow them.
