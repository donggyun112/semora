"""One suite, both stores. The only thing that keeps the in-memory and durable halves the same.

The memory implementations exist so a caller can find out whether its step boundaries and entry
shapes are right before paying for a database. That promise is worth nothing if the two answer
differently — a suite that passes in memory and fails on Postgres is worse than having no memory
store at all, because it moves the discovery from the test to production. `postgres.py` said as much
in its own docstring: *the semantics are tested through `MemorySteps` … but no test in this repo
connects to Postgres.* This file is what that sentence was waiting for.

So every property here runs over both `StepLog` implementations and both `Transcript` ones. The
Postgres half is skipped unless `SEMORA_TEST_DSN` is set, so **it is still unverified
in an ordinary run** — but the skip is visible, which is the point. Point it at a scratch database:

    export SEMORA_TEST_DSN=postgresql://localhost/runtime_test
    uv run pytest tests/test_store_conformance.py

Divergences it was written to catch, all now fixed:

* the in-memory transcript accepted run fields Postgres has no column for;
* the two disagreed about what identifies an entry, and about which conversation it belonged to;
* `read_branch` / `read_model_usage` existed on one side only;
* `MemorySteps.start` reopened a `done` step, so the in-memory ledger alone could lose a committed
  result on replay;
* `MemorySteps` ignored `ttl_seconds`, making lease takeover unreachable there;
* `MemorySteps.claim_input` raised `KeyError` where the durable store no-ops;
* `PostgresSteps.release` deleted the lease row, so the next token restarted at 1 and a stale worker
  passed the fence.

The last four are why the parity test alone is not enough: every one of them was a method both
stores had, doing different things.
